## Description:

In this assignment we [the student] modified starter code to create an application that enabled employees [the user] to generate random passwords based on criteria selected. These criteria include; size, numbers, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and special characters.

## Password Generator:

The password generator will start by asking the user the size of the password to be generated. It will then ask which type of characters to include in the password.

## Javascript:

We first created variables to be used for each criteria possible; length, uppercase, lowercase, special characters. We then determine which of these variables we neeed to use based on the User's prompts. We create a string that holds all the characters that are allowed. Finally, we will create the password by iterating over an empty string and randomly selecting characteers from our "allowed characters" string up to the selected string length.
